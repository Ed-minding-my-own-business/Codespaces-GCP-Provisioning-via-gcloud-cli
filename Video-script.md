Hi welcome to Ed minding my own business.

I make my videos because running a small cloud based business I find myself get getting involved in everything from paying staff via PAYE and digitly submitting it to the HMRC to renewing SSL certificates for our websites to hoovering the office carpet.

I'm always interested in solutions that can save time and imporve what we do.

What I'll be running a Codespaces form a public github repository and using it to connect to a Google Cloud Platform yo configuring an MS SQL servers.

OK so lots of the terms I have just use would have meant nothing to me 10 years ago and to be fare some of them didn't even exist ten years ago and I want people like me - from ten years ago -to be able to understand my videos.

So lets start with GitHub....

I remember about 10 years ago I asked my business partneer what GitHub was?.....

So far I have three video planned but there could be many more....

**Video 1**

I this video we'll connect a Codespace with a GitHub account and take a look arround.

**Video 2**

In the next video I'll show you how to use scripts in our Codespace to deploy an MS SQL server, register an IP address and link them together.

**Video 3**

In the third video I'll show you how to use scripts to administer the MS SQL server  

I decided to make these, video because I've seen some videos out there but nothing that really helped my specific use case.

But why would you want to use a GitHub codespace in the firstplace and what is a Codespace and what is GitHub and for that matter what is git.
