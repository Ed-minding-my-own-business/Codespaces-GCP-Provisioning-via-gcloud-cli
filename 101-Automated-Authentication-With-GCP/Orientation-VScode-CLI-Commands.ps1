<# VS CODE ORIENTATIONS COMMANDS

This file contains commands to interact with and return data from your GCP account

The commands below can be run a number of ways

1 - Writing (or copy and pasting) them in the PowerShell (or potentially other, bash etc) terminal and pressing Enter/Return. 

2 - Selecting/highlighting the commands individually and right clicking and selecting 'run selection' 

3 - Selecting/highlighting the commands individually and clicking on the 'Run Selection...' icon typically found near the top right of the Codespace page    

# OPENING A TERMINAL

If a terminal is not already open, one can be opened via the 'Hamburger' icon typically at the top left of the Codespaces page.

Alternatively, it can be opened via the file 'Explorer'.

The 'Explorer' icon is typically the first icon below the 'Hamburger' icon. Ensure this is selected 
then right click on the name of a file in the File Explorer and select 'Open in Intergrated Terminal'.

NB:  To exit a command in PowerShell press 'CTRL' & 'C' together
